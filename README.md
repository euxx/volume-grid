## Background

macOS Tohoe 26 changed the long-time system volume HUD: it now only appears in the top-right corner of the active display, removing the classic 16-tile feedback.

The new HUD is hard to read at a glance, especially on multiple displays where the active display might not be the one you're using. It also lacks separate tiles, making precise volume adjustment difficult.

Different websites, videos, or music often have varying volume levels, so I frequently adjust the volume. I created VolumeGrid for personal use initially. I've been using it from day one, iterating through several versions and fixing edge cases. It should be functional.
